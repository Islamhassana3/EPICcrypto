## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

**Good news!** The application now automatically detects if port 5000 is in use and finds an available alternative port.

When you run the app or use the preview scripts, you'll see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Port 5000 is already in use.
‚úÖ Starting server on alternative port: 5001
üåê Access the application at: http://localhost:5001
```

If you want to manually specify a different port:
```bash
# Change port in .env file
echo "PORT=8000" > .env

# Or run with custom port
export PORT=8000
python app.py
```

The app will use your specified port if available, or find the next available port automatically.

### Dependencies Won't Install
```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Try installing again
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Connection Errors

The app fetches data from CoinGecko and Binance APIs. If you see connection errors:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Wait a moment and refresh (APIs may have rate limits)
3. Try a different cryptocurrency

### Slow Predictions

First prediction takes longer as models are initialized. Subsequent predictions are faster due to caching.

### Can't Access from Other Devices
```bash
# Run with host 0.0.0.0
python app.py
# App will be accessible at http://YOUR_IP:5000
```

## Environment Variables

Optional configuration via `.env` file:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

```
