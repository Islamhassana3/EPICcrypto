## Understanding Recommendations

### Action Signals

| Signal | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Strong Buy** | Very bullish signals | Consider entering position |
| **Buy** | Bullish signals | Good entry point |
| **Hold** | Neutral or mixed | Wait for clearer signals |
| **Sell** | Bearish signals | Consider taking profits |
| **Strong Sell** | Very bearish signals | Consider exiting position |

### Confidence Scores

- **0.8 - 1.0**: High confidence (Strong signals)
- **0.6 - 0.8**: Good confidence (Clear trend)
- **0.4 - 0.6**: Moderate confidence (Mixed signals)
- **0.0 - 0.4**: Low confidence (Unclear trend)

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5000 is busy, run on a different port:

```bash
export PORT=8000
python app.py
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:8000`

### API Connection Errors

The app fetches data from CoinGecko and Binance APIs. If you see connection errors:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Wait a moment and refresh (APIs may have rate limits)
3. Try a different cryptocurrency

### Slow Predictions

First prediction takes longer as models are initialized. Subsequent predictions are faster due to caching.

## Environment Variables

Optional configuration via `.env` file:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
FLASK_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the UI**: Click through different coins and timeframes
2. **Try the API**: Use curl or Postman to test endpoints
3. **Read Documentation**: Check out `README.md` and `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
4. **Deploy to Railway**: Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` for production deployment
