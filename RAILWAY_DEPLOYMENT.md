# Railway.app Deployment Guide - Optimized for Production

This guide ensures 100% successful deployment of EPICcrypto on Railway.app.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ **Files Verified:**
- `app.py` - Flask application with production optimizations
- `requirements.txt` - Pinned dependency versions
- `Procfile` - Optimized Gunicorn configuration
- `runtime.txt` - Python 3.11 specification
- `railway.json` - Railway-specific configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build optimization for Railway
- `config.py` - Environment-based configuration
- `.dockerignore` - Clean deployment

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Production-ready Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway.app

1. **Sign in to Railway.app**
   - Visit: https://railway.app
   - Login with GitHub

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose `Islamhassana3/EPICcrypto`

3. **Auto-Configuration**
   Railway automatically detects:
   - ✅ Python 3.11 (from `runtime.txt`)
   - ✅ Dependencies (from `requirements.txt`)
   - ✅ Start command (from `Procfile` or `railway.json`)
   - ✅ Build configuration (from `nixpacks.toml`)

4. **Monitor Build**
   - Watch build logs in Railway dashboard
   - Build takes ~2-5 minutes
   - Look for "Deployment successful"

5. **Generate Domain**
   - Go to Settings → Networking
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Your app will be live at: `https://your-app.railway.app`

## Environment Variables (Optional)

Railway automatically sets `PORT`. Additional variables you can configure:

```
FLASK_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
CACHE_DURATION=60
CORS_ORIGINS=*
```

To add variables:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Variables"
3. Add key-value pairs

## Verification

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "EPICcrypto",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456",
  "services": "operational"
}
```

### 2. Test Endpoints

**Get Coins:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/coins
```

**Get Prediction:**
```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/prediction/BTC-USD?timeframe=1d"
```

**Multi-Timeframe:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/multi-timeframe/BTC-USD
```

### 3. Test UI
Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app`

   - 2 workers (optimal for Railway's CPU limits)
   - 4 threads per worker
   - 120-second timeout for long API calls
   - Proper logging to stdout/stderr

2. **Caching System**
   - 60-second data cache
   - Reduces API calls to Yahoo Finance
   - Improves response times
   - Prevents rate limiting

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - Graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages

4. **Health Monitoring**
   - Enhanced health check endpoint
   - Service status verification
   - Timestamp tracking
   - Degradation detection

### Build Optimizations

1. **nixpacks.toml**
   - Optimized Python 3.11 environment
   - Required system packages (gcc for compiling native extensions)
   - Efficient pip installation
   - Minimal build time

2. **railway.json**
   - Custom start command
   - Health check configuration
   - Restart policy (on failure)
   - Max 3 retries

3. **Dependency Pinning**
   - Exact versions in requirements.txt
   - Reproducible builds
   - Faster installation
   - No version conflicts

## Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

**Metrics to watch:**
- CPU usage (should be < 50%)
- Memory usage (should be < 512MB)
- Response time (should be < 5s)
- Build time (should be < 5 minutes)

### Logs

View real-time logs:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Select active deployment
4. Click "View Logs"

**Look for:**
- ✅ "Services initialized successfully"
- ✅ "Gunicorn started"
- ✅ "Listening on 0.0.0.0:PORT"
- ❌ Any ERROR or CRITICAL messages

### Common Log Messages

**Good:**
```
INFO - Services initialized successfully
INFO - Cache hit for BTC-USD:1d
INFO - Prediction generated for BTC-USD: BUY
INFO - Multi-timeframe prediction completed for ETH-USD: 8 timeframes
```

**Warnings (Normal):**
```
WARNING - No data for BTC-USD at 1m
WARNING - Invalid timeframe 2h, defaulting to 1d
```

**Errors (Need Attention):**
```
ERROR - Error fetching data for INVALID-USD
ERROR - Failed to initialize services
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Problem:** Dependencies fail to install

**Solution:**
1. Check requirements.txt syntax
2. Verify Python version in runtime.txt
3. Check Railway build logs for specific error
4. Ensure all dependencies are available on PyPI

### App Crashes on Start

**Problem:** Application exits immediately after starting

**Solution:**
1. Check Procfile syntax
2. Verify environment variables (especially PORT)
3. Check logs for initialization errors
4. Test locally: `python app.py`

### Slow Response Times

**Problem:** API responses take > 10 seconds

**Solution:**
1. Check Yahoo Finance API availability
2. Verify caching is working (check logs for "Cache hit")
3. Consider reducing timeout: `CACHE_DURATION=30`
4. Monitor Railway CPU/memory usage

### Health Check Failing

**Problem:** Railway shows "Unhealthy"

**Solution:**
1. Verify /api/health endpoint works: `curl https://your-app/api/health`
2. Check healthcheck timeout in railway.json
3. Review logs for service initialization errors
4. Ensure services start within 100 seconds

## Performance Tuning

### For High Traffic

If you expect > 100 requests/minute:

1. **Increase Workers**
   - Edit Procfile: `--workers 4`
   - Requires more memory

2. **Add Redis Caching**
   ```bash
   # Add to requirements.txt
   redis==5.0.1
   
   # Add environment variable
   REDIS_URL=<railway-redis-url>
   ```

3. **Upgrade Railway Plan**
   - More CPU/memory resources
   - Better performance

### For Low Traffic

If you have < 10 requests/minute:

1. **Reduce Workers**
   - Edit Procfile: `--workers 1`
   - Saves memory

2. **Increase Cache Duration**
   - Set: `CACHE_DURATION=300` (5 minutes)
   - Fewer API calls

## Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling

Railway supports running multiple instances:

1. Go to Settings → Deployment
2. Enable "Auto-scaling" (on paid plans)
3. Set min/max replicas

### Vertical Scaling

Upgrade your Railway plan for:
- More CPU cores
- More RAM
- Better network bandwidth

## Security

### Production Checklist

- ✅ No secrets in code
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ HTTPS enabled (automatic on Railway)
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Error messages sanitized
- ✅ Logging doesn't expose sensitive data

### Recommended (Advanced)

1. **Add API Rate Limiting**
2. **Enable Authentication** (if needed)
3. **Add Request Validation**
4. **Set up Monitoring Alerts**

## Cost Management

### Free Tier Limits

Railway free tier includes:
- $5 of usage per month
- ~500 hours of uptime
- Public repositories only

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use Caching** - Reduces compute time
2. **Efficient Queries** - Minimize API calls
3. **Proper Timeouts** - Don't hang on slow requests
4. **Monitor Usage** - Check Railway dashboard
